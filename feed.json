Not only are there many projects going on at times, but how your work is managed can be split between tools. We use Jira, Confluence, and Github at work, I use Todoist to deal with personal tasks and projects, and then Notion sits in between all of those helping to bring the information needed to the front. In this blog post, I will walk through how I use Notion as a software engineer to keep my work running smoothly and streamline how I capture interesting or important information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-work-log\">The Work Log</h2>\n<p>Keeping a Daily/Weekly Work Log is a great way to document what you worked on during the day and any questions you want to bring up at Standup the next morning. This can be done in any note-taking tool, but I find that Notion is particularly useful for this purpose. I have a daily template set up that I use to log my work and any questions I may have. This template includes sections for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tasks completed</li>\n<li>Problems encountered</li>\n<li>Questions for the team</li>\n<li>Things to follow up on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been incredibly helpful in keeping my update concise and to the point while not forgetting something I need help with.

These templates can be used for everything from meeting notes to planning sprints, and they can be easily shared with other members of your team. These allow you to spend less time setting things up and more time capturing the important information needed during meetings. For example, I have a template set up for meeting notes that includes sections for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agenda</li>\n<li>Attendees</li>\n<li>Discussions</li>\n<li>Action items</li>\n<li>Follow-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been extremely helpful in keeping track of what was discussed during meetings and what the next steps are. I also have a template for capturing my achievements and work during the year. This way when it comes time for reviews I have a breakdown of all of the things I was proud of throughout the year. This can be very helpful at companies of all sizes and makes your manager’s life easier when understanding your impact. There are endless ways templates can be used, but I think this is a major reason to use Notion or a similar tool over something like Apple Notes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-clipper\">Web Clipper</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/web-clipper\">The Notion Web Clipper</a> has fully replaced Instapaper or Chrome/Safari Reading Lists for me. It allows me to capture helpful articles, links, even things like README’s from Github. It works on pretty much any browser and mobile and is an easy way to quickly capture web pages that you want to reference later. It also tries to pull the text into a page so you can search over the content of all of your saved links. The Web Clipper is an extremely helpful tool when you are starting a new project as well since you can gather a massive amount of information and references very quickly without having to keep a million tabs open.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/43080/2023/5fd90bfbf1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"teamspaces-and-notion-ai\">Teamspaces and Notion AI</h2>\n<p>Notion&rsquo;s recent release of team spaces and Notion AI has made it an even more versatile tool for software engineers.

				"content_html": "<p>As I move on to the next chapter in my career, I wanted to reflect on the past two years at Illuminate. Here are the lessons learned from moving to a 20 person startup from a 26k person company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Things move fast.</li>\n<li>You can make an immediate impact on the organization.</li>\n<li>Your architecture will reflect your organization.</li>\n<li>Managing is more than 1 on 1’s.</li>\n<li>Culture matters even more than at a larger organization.</li>\n<li>Healthcare software is challenging, the data is not uniform, but is some of the most rewarding work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"things-move-fast\">Things move fast.</h3>\n<p>Coming from a larger company, I was used to quarterly planning, long release cycles, and processes for just about everything. One of my favorite things about going to a startup was how quickly we moved. The only processes that existed were for compliance and to ensure high quality with our changes. If you have an idea, or want try something you are empowered to do it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Being at a startup, you can have a tremendous amount of impact and responsibility. It can be a great opportunity to take a chance or risk but can also create silo’s of critical information. During my second year, we decided to try a new approach and have engineers focus on a general area of architecture instead of a product and also participate in a support rotation. With the level of tech debt we were facing, this was an extremely painful switch. Three months in we noticed our team had quickly destroyed most of these silo’s and documented some of our unknowns. One of my coworkers during this time, started writing down everything he came across during his support rotation and how to reproduce or fix the issues. He not only fixed a lot of the issues but he created a shared space that included all the details. As time went on, the rest of the team followed suite and this became one of the greatest changes our team made. He didn’t tell anyone else to do it, just showed everyone and the team immediately bought it. The time spent on support decreased by almost half due to this. I just think that is a great example of how even little things can make a big difference, and when the team is only 8 people, you really feel it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"organizational-architecture\">Organizational Architecture</h3>\n<p>One of the things I was excited to be involved in was helping relayout our company’s org chart to be closer to how we did business. From an engineering perspective, there were three things I thought really made an impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We made engineering flatter and less specific, aka SWE’s and SRE’s shared responsibilities and worked closer together.</li>\n<li>Support was incorporated into the entire engineering team versus being something dealt with by client services.</li>\n<li>We created processes that captured data and work being done so we could make objective decisions versus relying on people’s experiences purely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This ended up showing us some of our biggest pain points and we were able to rapidly adjust.</p>\n<p>The next thing we spent a lot of time trying to figure out was how to have client services interact with the engineering team. This led to building out tools and processes that let each organization be more independent from each other. We integrated our work tracking tools like Monday and Jira, and we identified things engineering could pass off to client services to speed up client onboarding. When I first started, client services was at the whim of engineering which meant these tasks like onboarding or transforming data was always held up by engineering. While I am sure this is still ongoing today, we made massive improvements that really helped our teams work together instead of bottleneck each other.</p>\n<h3 id=\"managing-a-team\">Managing a Team</h3>\n<p>Illuminate was my first chance to really manage an entire team. At my previous company, I managed a team of 5 engineers in an organization of 200. This was a wildly different experience. Three hard learning lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong individual contributors do not always make strong managers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I believe it can be dangerous to move too slow promoting or recognizing a strong team member, it can be worse to put them in a position they cannot continue to succeed in. Annual review cycles work and prevent a lot of political issues within an organization. There are also times where it makes sense to move someone into a new role outside of cycles, but those should be something done as infrequently as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your direct reports should always have a good understanding of how they are performing, aka they should not be caught off guard with good or bad news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Communication and regular 1 on 1’s are not for you to talk about work, they are there to let your direct report talk with you about anything on their mind and for you to communicate anything about their personal growth within the organization. If you have to let someone go or put them on a performance plan, they should be aware that it was coming. Being caught off guard is not a fun situation for your direct report and will probably lead to a poor professional relationship with them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watch out for legends of the old guard or team members talking about things that “just work” or “don’t want to mess with”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really got kicked in the butt when I realized all the stories about previous engineering teams doing miracle work or having to do something extraordinary was just a cover up for tech debt. Nothing is worse than getting a call from a client about a piece of your tech stack that you do not have strong visibility over.</p>\n<p>The biggest takeaway I have is that, as a manager, you are there to help your direct reports succeed and provide a buffer from things that prevent them from being able to do great work. You can’t be everyone’s friend but you also need to recognize that you are there to help them first and foremost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"culture\">Culture</h3>\n<p>If there was only one thing I could take away from this last experience, it would be how important a good work culture is. Especially in a fast paced environment, I realized the health of the team is dependent on making sure work is somewhere where everyone feels supported and can be themselves. When things start getting challenging or an emergency happens, it seemed like these are the things that make the biggest difference. Going forward, will be one of the main things I look for in a company. It cannot be an after thought, it needs to be a priority. I don’t mean free food and ping pong tables or extra days off, but a place that supports their staff in the work they do and understands employees have lives outside of work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"healthcare-software\">Healthcare Software</h3>\n<p>Healthcare software and data is a mess. Nothing is uniform due to the emergence and integration of electronic medical records over the last 40 years. There are some exciting companies and projects tackling those problems around data uniformity and cross organization data sharing, but while I was at Illuminate, it was both fun and challenging working on the data ingestion pipelines across our client base. While everything is generally similar, no two hospitals are the same which led us down some interesting paths around solving this problem at scale. The other interesting thing about AI or machine learning in healthcare is the amount of insights or data points generated versus how many are actually acted on. One of the biggest things I learned was that follow-up, or helping the hospitals track patients related to some insight is one of the biggest holes in the digital space right now. I am excited to see where the team goes the next couple of years working on these problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I had a great two years at Illuminate and will miss working with the engineering team. It was my first time getting to lead a team of that size and learned a lot in the process. Looking forward, I feel like the experience prepared me for what is to come in my next couple chapters.</p>\n",

This is something that can be extremely helpful when working in web applications or in apps that have a mixture of web and native content as do ours at Cerner.</p>\n<p>Enabling Safari Debugging\nIf you are on a real device you will need to enable the Web Inspector first. Open Settings, then open Safari, scroll to the bottom and open Advanced. You should see an option for Web Inspector, enable this and you will see your phone as an option in the Develop menu item.</p>\n<p>If you are using a simulator, there is no setup after enabling the Develop mode in Safari.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/43080/2021/5e77785356.png\" alt=\"Safari Settings\"></p>\n<p>Enabling the Develop Menu Item\nIn Safari you will need to enable the Develop menu item before you can see any other available devices for inspection.

				"content_text": "This week I wanted to talk about how to use Safari’s Developer Tools with Simulators or iOS devices in Safari or in your application’s web views. This is something that can be extremely helpful when working in web applications or in apps that have a mixture of web and native content as do ours at Cerner.\n\nEnabling Safari Debugging\nIf you are on a real device you will need to enable the Web Inspector first. Open Settings, then open Safari, scroll to the bottom and open Advanced. You should see an option for Web Inspector, enable this and you will see your phone as an option in the Develop menu item.\n\nIf you are using a simulator, there is no setup after enabling the Develop mode in Safari.\n\n![Safari Settings](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/43080/2021/5e77785356.png)\n\nEnabling the Develop Menu Item\nIn Safari you will need to enable the Develop menu item before you can see any other available devices for inspection. Open Preferences `⌘ + ,` and open the Advanced section. At the bottom, check the box next to “Show Develop menu in menu bar”. Now you should see the Develop menu item and can chose web views or browser tabs to inspect on real devices or simulators!\n\n![Develop Menu](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/43080/2021/26a428e244.png)\n\nYou are now all set! You can interact with the web inspector just like you can in Desktop Safari. The only caveat is that this will not work for apps that are from TestFlight or the App Store, so debug mode only. Hope this helps and happy coding!\n",

				"title": "My Top 17 Apps for Mobile Developers in 2020",
				"content_html": "<p>As a mobile developer, having the right tools and setup on your machine can become a massive time saver and boost your productivity especially over time. While a lot of your development environment comes down to personal preference, these are the apps and plugins that are my &ldquo;must haves&rdquo; on any machine. I am thinking after this I want to do a tutorial on my dotfiles and setup scripts that install a lot of these from the Mac App Store and elsewhere. Also these are in no particular order as some aren’t comparable to others when it comes down to usefulness or necessity.</p>\n<p>Xcode\nOkay, so this is obvious, you cannot get too far building mobile apps without this app. Even if you use a hybrid framework, you will still need Xcode to create and publish any iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or MacOS app.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\">Download Xcode on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Screen Sharing\nThis is an app that comes with your Mac that I use all the time at work. If we ever need to hop on a build machine this is honestly one of the easiest ways to do it. I have never had any issues or reasons to go download a better client, it does what its supposed to and saves your recent connections.</p>\n<p>FileMerge\nThis comes with the Xcode Developer Tools, I would not say this is my favorite file merge tool, even using Atom is way better but the GUI is nice when you have two files in Finder or on your desktop you want to compare quickly. If I am trying to find the differences between two text files or something simple, I use this.</p>\n<p>Android Studio\nAlong with Xcode, this is basically a requirement. You can use other IDE’s a little easier than Xcode, but I still think the official JetBrains version from Google is the easiest to use. There is a ton of configuration that goes along with Android Studio, but in my opinion is the easiest to use IDE for the job.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\">Download Android Studio</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Atom\nAtom has been my go-to editor for everything since college. While it seems <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">VSCode</a> has taken the new throne these days, I still fall back on Atom. The maturity of the plugins and the ability to install things quickly have always been huge selling points to me. Not a huge fan of chromium apps, but I still love using Atom. There are great plugins for things like previewing markdown either in the editor or in Marked 2, the git integration is not bad, and I love how quickly I can install support for a language or a plugin in the case I don’t already have something. Downsides are a lot of the plugins lose support over time and being a Chromium app, things tend to slowdown if you have too much going on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io\">Download Atom</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bear Notes\nI have tried so many notes apps for things like blogging to taking notes in meetings and finally settled on Bear. Previously I was using Apple Notes and Agenda, but the markdown support in Bear is awesome. I do miss the tables in Apple notes, but I love the hashtag system for creating groups and folders. It is super easy to link to other notes and you do things like lock notes or groups just like Apple Notes. If you subscribe to Pro, you get a bunch of great themes, export options, and syncing. It also works great with Marked 2 for previewing how things will look. Also sounds like tables and a couple other missing features are coming to Bear. Agenda was honestly really great, but felt it lacked too many basic features and I didn’t really use all the time based stuff it is built around.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1091189122?mt=12\">Download Bear Notes on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Marked 2\nI started using Marked 2 when we started using Github for more and more things at work. It is a previewer for markdown files that allows you to style your text, check spelling, and a whole lot more.  It is nice when writing up a tech design to be able to preview it with Marked and see what it will look like once you push it. You can also create custom styles which I will be doing a post on later too. This is useful for previewing things like blog posts in the style or layout of your website. One cool thing you can do too is export as HTML, which could be helpful for blogging or create web articles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marked-2-markdown-preview/id890031187?mt=12\">Download Marked 2 on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SnippetsLab\nSnippetsLab is great library for saving useful snippets across IDE’s and editors. It also has support for syncing with Github Gist’s or iCloud so you can backup all these and sync across devices. I have it on my work and personal laptops which is great for using helpful bits of code in personal and work projects. It has tons of organization options and support for markdown as well if you wanted to use it for that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snippetslab/id1006087419?mt=12\">Download ‎SnippetsLab on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tower\nSo I hesitated putting this on here, but if you absolutely have to use a GUI, then I guess this is the best of the GUI’s for Git. I highly recommend learning and using git in the command line, but if you really don’t want to, Tower is definitely the best one I have used over Github’s Mac app and other editors built-in Git support. You limit what and how you do things with a WYSIWYG tool, but Tower is the better of the evils.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/mac\">Download Tower</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SF Symbols\nSF Symbols is a sweet app from Apple that lets you browse the new system icons available in iOS 13. While using the <code>init?(systemName name:  String)</code>  is only <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/3294233-init\">available in iOS 13</a>, you can use this app to export these icons as SVG’s for use in your apps that support iOS 12 and below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/\">Download SF Symbols</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Swift Playgrounds\nWhile this one is not really going to boost your productivity or be a new tool in your development toolbox, it is a great way to play around with Swift or learn. It also has support for some things like Lego Mindstorms, which is pretty cool. It supports Xcode Playgrounds also, so if you are doing anything in Xcode Playgrounds, it can be a more visually appealing way to interact or code in them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id1496833156?mt=12\">Download Swift Playgrounds on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>iTerm\niTerm is a terminal replacement that brings a lot to the table out of the box. You have search, easy window splitting, a really cool new status bar, autocomplete, and a whole lot more. And that is before any customization of your shell. I don’t think it makes too big of a difference using iTerm versus Terminal.app considering most of the magic comes from setting up your shell to your needs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/index.html\">Download iTerm2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sketch\nSketch is a prototyping tool that lets you create mockups and designs for software products. I have been using it for quite some time and even though I don’t do too much graphic design or UX stuff, I do love using it for my personal projects or wireframes. Compared to things like Omnigraffle or other similar tools, it is my favorite by far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sketch.com\">Download Sketch</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pocket\nPocket is my favorite app for saving and sharing links. I have it on my iPhone, iPad, and both Macs and it does a great job of syncing saved links between them all. The desktop client has a quick command for saving links that are in your clipboard if you don’t use the browser or share extensions as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket/id568494494?mt=12\">‎Download Pocket on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RESTed\nRESTed is a lightweight REST API client, it is essentially a boiled down version of Postman. I enjoy using this a lot more than Postman for things like personal projects and the ability to save requests as files is nice for simple things. I use it mainly on personal projects and stick to Postman for things like work or more complex calls.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rested-simple-http-requests/id421879749?mt=12\">Download ‎RESTed on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>InjectionIII\nInjection is a really cool app that lets you add some “hot reloading” to your Xcode projects. It supports iOS, tvOS, or MacOS. It is not perfect but can be really helpful when making lots of small UI tweaks or changes. I usually add it and occasionally enable it when needed. It is easy to setup with just a single line.\n<code>Bundle(path: “/Applications/InjectionIII.app/Contents/Resources/iOSInjection.bundle”)?.load()</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/injectioniii/id1380446739?mt=12\">Download ‎InjectionIII on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DevCleaner\nDevCleaner is a great app for clearing out old device support files, derived  data, or or old archives. It has an easy interface to see and sort through what you want to delete or keep. Hovering over the top level sections will tell you what each is if you are not familiar with the Xcode build system. It has a cool counter of how many GB’s you have “saved” along with a way to leave a tip to the developer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devcleaner-for-xcode/id1388020431\">Download ‎DevCleaner for Xcode on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JSONPeep\nFor my work’s slew of apps, they tend to have a good chunk of web content, which means using Safari’s developer tools to inspect the web view’s etc. So this plugin is a huge help if, like me, you end up using Safari a majority of the time. It allows you to view JSON in a readable format adding a little button to whenever you view a JSON file in your browser.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/json-peep-for-safari/id1458969831?mt=12\">Download ‎JSON Peep for Safari on the Mac App Store</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sip\nSip is the best color picker for Mac that I have found. You always have access to it from the Menu Bar and it allows you to save, copy, and organize your recently picked colors. It also lets you copy them in a ton of formats like NSColor, UIColor, or just hexadecimal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://sipapp.io\">Download Sip</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So while this list definitely is always changing, these are my current go to applications for mobile development in one way or another. I hope this helps and maybe some of these are new to you! Anyways, enjoy and please let me know what some of your favorites are not on this list.</p>\n",

Met some more great developers and hung out with my fellow Cerner dev, Young. Got some pictures with Craig from Apple and then that was about it. Now time to get back to the real world!\n",

I had some awesome conversations in the HealthKit Labs with one of the doctors that worked on the Health Records Feature in Apple Health with Cerner which was very cool and then went to some cool lunch and evening panels with the Health teams talking about their new features, how they deal with regulations, and the future of features like the ECG on the watch. It was also super interesting hearing developers voice concern and challenge some of the their blanket statement responses on a couple questions. After that, I grabbed some WWDC swag and headed out for the day over to a WeWork happy hour. That was pretty short, so went home got ready for the night and headed over to Live Near WWDC, a concert put on by James Dempsey and the Breakpoints. It was an awesome event, met so many great people, from some guys from the Target iOS Team, freelances from Australia, Dave Verwer, and then some super cool Apple engineers. All in all, this was by far the most packed and fun day yet.</p>\n",

The sessions on SF Symbols and creating independent watch apps was super cool. The idea of a watch being able to be used with a phone at all and got me very excited for the upcoming hardware releases in September. Throughout the day I attended the WatchOS and SiriKit Labs, where I had 1 on 1 time with Apple engineers diving into current problems I have with my apps and how we could be leveraging some of these new or recently released features.

The Apple Store employees helping everyone were so high energy and hilarious throughout the day, l literally do not understand how they stayed so excited for the entire day. Once I got registered and received my badge, we left the building and re-entered a line for the keynote. I had gotten there a little bit before 6:30 so I ended up getting a pretty good seat.

I have watched it every year since high school and it was amazing getting to actually be there this year. I have been playing with SwiftUI a little and already am getting very excited for this change. I think this is something that is going to drastically improve the quality of apps and the ease of development. The baked in accessibility is huge, for us at Cerner it is such an important item and having a lot of it out of the box is amazing. Following that, the watchOS changes were my second favorite. Standalone watch apps are amazing and I can’t wait to play with that this week.
